 ## Target Audience: Developers

This project integrates the [Open WebUI](https://github.com/open-webui/open-webui) as the backend and frontend for a machine learning operations (MLOps) environment. It includes custom-built infrastructure such as Jenkins CI/CD pipelines, Kubernetes for orchestration, deployments on Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE), etc. The project aims to provide hands-on experience with MLOps, leveraging Open WebUI‚Äôs capabilities to manage and deploy large language models (LLMs) in a scalable, cloud-native environment.


## Key Features of Open WebUI ‚≠ê (from [@open-webui/open-webui](https://github.com/open-webui/open-webui))

## Getting Started

### Local Development

**1. Clone the Repository:**

First, you'll need to clone the project's repository from GitHub to your local machine. This will create a copy of the codebase in a directory named `PromptAlchemy`.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/bmd1905/PromptAlchemy.git
cd PromptAlchemy
```

**2. Backend Setup:**

To set up the backend, follow these steps:

- **(Optional) Conda Environment:**

  It's recommended to use a Conda environment to manage dependencies and avoid conflicts with other Python projects. If you don't have Conda installed, you can install it by following the instructions on the [Anaconda website](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/).

  ```bash
  conda create --name open-webui-env python=3.11
  conda activate open-webui-env
  ```

- **Install Dependencies:**

  Install the required Python packages using `pip`. The `-r requirements.txt` option ensures all dependencies listed in the `requirements.txt` file are installed. The `-U` flag is used to upgrade packages to the latest version if possible.

  ```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt -U
  ```

- **Start the Backend Server:**

  After installing the dependencies, you can start the backend server using the provided script. This script will launch the server, making it ready to handle API requests.

  ```bash
  bash start.sh
  ```

**3. Frontend Setup:**

The frontend of the application is located in the `open-webui` directory. To set it up, navigate to the directory and install the necessary dependencies:

```bash
cd open-webui
npm install
```

- **Build and Run the Frontend:**

  Once the dependencies are installed, build the frontend assets and start the development server:

  ```bash
  npm run build
  npm run dev
  ```

  The development server will host the frontend, allowing you to interact with the application via a web browser.

**4. Configuration:**

To configure the application, you'll need to set up environment variables. The `.env.example` file contains example configurations. Copy this file to `.env` and fill in the required variables, such as API keys for language models.

```bash
cp -RPp .env.example .env
```

Edit the `.env` file with your specific configuration details, ensuring that all required environment variables are set.

## Production Deployment

### Using Terraform for Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE)

**1. Set up the Cluster:**

If you're deploying the application to GKE, you can use Terraform to automate the setup of your Kubernetes cluster. Navigate to the `iac/terraform` directory and initialize Terraform:

```bash
cd iac/terraform
terraform init
```

**Plan and Apply Configuration:**

  Generate an execution plan to verify the resources that Terraform will create or modify, and then apply the configuration to set up the cluster:

  ```bash
  terraform plan
  terraform apply
  ```

**2. Retrieve Cluster Information:**

To interact with your GKE cluster, you'll need to retrieve its configuration. You can view the current cluster configuration with the following command:

```bash
cat ~/.kube/config
```

Ensure your `kubectl` context is set correctly to manage the cluster.

### Manual Deployment to GKE

For a more hands-on deployment process, follow these steps:

**1. Deploy Nginx Ingress Controller:**

The Nginx Ingress Controller manages external access to services in your Kubernetes cluster. Create a namespace and install the Ingress Controller using Helm:

```bash
kubectl create ns nginx-system
kubens nginx-system
helm upgrade --install nginx-ingress ./deployments/nginx-ingress
```

**2. Configure API Key Secret:**

Store your environment variables, such as API keys, securely in Kubernetes secrets. Create a namespace for model serving and create a secret from your `.env` file:

```bash
kubectl create ns model-serving
kubens model-serving
kubectl delete secret promptalchemy-env 
kubectl create secret generic promptalchemy-env --from-env-file=.env -n model-serving
kubectl describe secret promptalchemy-env -n model-serving
```

**3. Grant Permissions:**

Kubernetes resources often require specific permissions. Apply the necessary roles and bindings:

```bash
cd deployments/infrastructure
kubectl apply -f role.yaml
kubectl apply -f rolebinding.yaml
```

**4. Deploy LiteLLM:**

Deploy the [LiteLLM](https://github.com/BerriAI/litellm) service:

```bash
kubens model-serving
helm upgrade --install litellm ./deployments/litellm
```

**5. Deploy the Open WebUI:**

Next, Deploy the web UI to your GKE cluster:

```bash
cd open-webui
kubens model-serving
kubectl apply -f ./kubernetes/manifest/base
```

**6. Deploy semantic caching service using Redis:**

Now, deploy the semantic caching service using Redis:
```bash
cd ./deployments/redis
helm dependency build
helm upgrade --install redis .
```

### Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) with Jenkins and Ansible

For automated CI/CD pipelines, use Jenkins and Ansible as follows:

**1. Set up Jenkins Server:**

Create a Google Compute Engine instance for Jenkins. Ensure it's accessible on the necessary ports:

- **Instance Name:** jenkins-server
- **OS:** Ubuntu 22.04
- **Ports:** Allow traffic on 8081 (Jenkins UI) and 50000 (Jenkins agent).

**2. Deploy Jenkins:**

Use Ansible to automate the deployment of Jenkins on your instance:

```bash
ansible-playbook -i iac/ansible/inventory iac/ansible/deploy_jenkins/deploy_jenkins.yaml
```

**3. Access Jenkins:**

Once Jenkins is deployed, access it via your browser:

```plaintext
http://<EXTERNAL_IP>:8081
```

**4. Install Jenkins Plugins:**

Install the following plugins to integrate Jenkins with Docker, Kubernetes, and GKE:

- Docker
- Docker Pipeline
- Kubernetes
- GCloud SDK
- Google Kubernetes Engine

**5. Configure Jenkins:**

Set up your GitHub repository in Jenkins, and add the necessary credentials for DockerHub and GKE.

### Monitoring with Prometheus

To monitor your deployed application, follow these steps:

**1. Install Dependencies:**

Prometheus requires certain dependencies that can be managed with Helm. Navigate to the monitoring directory and build these dependencies:

```bash
cd deployments/monitoring/kube-prometheus-stack
helm dependency build
```

**2. Deploy Prometheus:**

Deploy Prometheus and its associated services using Helm:

```bash
helm upgrade --install -f deployments/monitoring/kube-prometheus-stack.expanded.yaml kube-prometheus-stack deployments/monitoring/kube-prometheus-stack -n monitoring
```

This setup will provide monitoring capabilities for your Kubernetes cluster, ensuring you can track performance and troubleshoot issues.
